# CompGraphics

This project showcased the ability to render 2D objects within a 3D environment using OpenGL within Visual Studio using C++ language.

How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I approach designing software with a fundamental philosophy. I first think about the objects I wanted to use within the scene and how I would render them within a 3D space. After rendering them within the scene I would then have to alter the coordinates for each object to align with what I wanted to accomplish (in this case, a house). This project taught me how to analyze and create objects within a 3D space and how to use coordinates to place these objects in a way that would reflect the real world. 

These tactics could be applied in future work because I now understand how OpenGL works within Visual Studio and how to create 2D objects within a 3D plane and utilizing keyboard/mouse clicks to change camera angles and movement.

How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

When I approach developing programs I take into consideration both the waterfall and agile apporach to development. It is always good to have a layout of what to tackle first and move on from there (using the waterfall method), but it is also important to consider the agile approach when developing; it allows you to revisit past classes/code to make sure that everything is working properly. I found that checking code constantly helped in improving the overall efficiency and correctness.

I would say I adapted an apporach of checking/building the finished program more often while writing code. I found myself writing a few lines and building/running the code to make sure the minor details were working properly.
